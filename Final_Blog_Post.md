### Author’s ~~Rant~~ Note
Boy, where do I even begin? This whole project right from the beginning has been a complete sh**show, but I’m just glad it’s finally over. I just want to apologize in advance for the lack of effort and dedication from the start. Because of my lack of effort to find something creative to work on, this made the project infinitely harder. Regardless, I love the ability to be informal when given as this makes the reflection significantly easier. Rant over, I’m just glad I got to turn this in even if ~~the possibility that~~ it’ll be extremely late. 
### Initial Idea
The initial plan was to create a website that displays the overall relationship between data analytics and (college club) gymnastics. The idea was to gather score data from the NAIGC (National Association of Intercollegiate Gymnastics Clubs) from the last decade and trying to see patterns regarding the format of scoring events. While the idea seemed ambiguous, I found it straightforward to analyze as compared to other sports, gymnastics is relatively niche. As gymnastics is not as popular as main stream sports such as football or soccer, the evolution of data analytics and science is not as developed. Because of this, trying to find patterns of data analytics within a club setting seemed reasonable at the time.

The other reason for choosing this idea is because of the vast difference in scoring compared to other sports. While other sports have a (most of the time) simple numbering system to keep score which increases, gymnastics is one of the few exceptions to that rule. Scoring in gymnastics is calculated from having the highest theoretical first which decreases with the amount of penalties witnessed from the judges. Because of this, scores can actually be subjective to a certain extent which makes researching in the influence of subjectivity within gymnastics very interesting to me. Evidently, there is some objectivity in scoring and judging athletes during competitions, but this has been the case as I see from my perspective as a spectator and athlete. Gymnastics is one of the few sports where subjectivity for the state of the meta and scoring of skills vastly influence the overall sport in general. Obviously, other sports also experience this universal rule, but gymnastics is significantly influenced by this phenomenon.   
### Process
As mentioned earlier, trying to webscrape from a website that includes results that were formatted in such a format was too ambitious. Those ambitions plus, let’s be honest, a lack of effort made the initial idea almost immediately. As a result, the process truly started off with having a one on one discussion with Professor LeBlanc. In that discussion, the suggestion was to find existing data sets that exist for gymnastics and utilize that data instead. This made the process significantly easier and thus doable as my initial idea like mentioned earlier was too ambitious from my lack of knowledge back then. As a result, instead of trying to find a dataset with an extremely convoluted route, I simply used the route of analyzing a dataset from a certain year and analyzing that. While admittedly this means most of the work has been done for me, it also makes the process easier as it all requires from my part is to create and analyze scores from a dataset rather than try collecting data with a format that would be too complex for myself. The dataset that I analyzed is from the Men’s Artistic Gymnastics All-Around (Every event in Men’s gymnastics is competed) Championships of the year 2017. After deciding on this, analysis of the events was pretty straightforward to be honest. All it came down was simply creating visuals and analyzing said visuals. If anything, most of the difficulty came from trying to create visuals that looked consistent. Otherwise, the process was surprisingly straightforward. It’s just a shame that it took me this long but whatever I guess. 
### Analysis
This dataset makes me curious as although the dataset isn’t from the Olympics, most of the data in this dataset seems to resemble the overall atmosphere of the Olympics. Examples include which countries are usually at the top and which athletes score the highest, etc. This relates to some of the readings as I realize how significant this data can be even from Giorgia Lupi's blog post which mentions that data itself doesn't have to be used with malicious intent. If anything most of the readings I’ll mention relate to having visuals supporting the arguments. All of the blogs mentioned relate to this and I personally utilize this as this makes reading through blog posts more interesting. The other blog post I was inspired by was from “Deep Fried Data” from Maciej Cegłowski. This blog post relates to this blog post as all data has be gardened well for any analysis. If it weren’t for the people creating and analyzing datasets in general, none of this would be feasible. Because of this, I appreciate the people more for creating datasets as that data can be useful in its own way.

It’s interesting to note how similar the rankings of both the athletes and countries are to the global standings in Men’s Gymnastics (Women’s Gymnastics have some differences). For example, the top three winners of this championship are China and Japan. If comparing this to the total amount of gold medals earned by each countries, the top three countries are the Soviet Union, Japan, and China. This correlates with our data set as the top three countries (not athletes) in this dataset are the same countries (obviously USSR and Russia are different but they’re essentially the same in terms of origin). There is some discrepancy with other countries but the overall ranking of this championship is similar to the current global standing for Men’s gymnastics. Although this data is biased as being a championship rather than an Olympic standing, the standings for this data being similar to the global standings in Men’s gymnastics is by no means a coincidence.

An interesting to note for the Chinese competitors is both competitors being extremely good at Pommel Horse yet are around average in terms of rank on Rings. This is interesting to note as Pommel Horse is considered the “Dark Horse” (no pun intended) of the apparatus in men’s gymnastics. This is noted in the data above when examining countries. The outliers on this graph are from Rings which makes this even more interesting. Objectively, pommel horse is one of the hardest events yet both competitors are top 3 but Rings on the other hand is around average ranking for both competitors. This is to not say these competitors are bad, but surprising to me as Rings, while still difficult, is nowhere near as difficult as the hellish spawn of an apparatus known as Pommel Horse. 
### ~~Conclusion~~ Lesson Learned
In conclusion, don’t be a stuck-up moron when it comes to projects. Frankly, I have never been so demotivated to do a project and I have no one else to blame but myself. Regardless, there were other topics relating to this class that did help me with writing this blog post. If what all of these have in common is getting inspiration for this blog post itself. Besides that however, there were lessons learned with these other readings that inspired me. The big inspiration for this blog post for sure that helped with writing and creating this blog post is Lincoln Mullen’s blog post, “Isn’t it obvious?”. The main reason for this is simple: keep it simple. Mullen’s post in general looks straightforward and simple for readers to follow without any complex effects. Although that would help gain new readers, only having a small group of people read the blog post might make the effort extremely marginal in the end. Overall, this project was something I would have enjoyed more in the end, but I’ll learn my lesson by trying to keep a consistent time schedule in the future.
